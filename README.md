# Coding Test

Coding Project 1

The first page was designed to look as similar as I could get it without a photoshop file. With the exception of specific colors and shadows. 

The page is created using the bootstrap grid system, but it could be done with tables or pure flexbox. It depends on how the page is intended to function.

The page needs more added for accessability and SEO though I added the basics.
A second page is to come.
