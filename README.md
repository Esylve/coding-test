# Coding Test

Coding Project 1

The first page was designed to look as similar as I could get it without a photoshop file. With the exception of specific colors and shadows. 

The page is created using the bootstrap grid system, but it could be done with tables or pure flexbox. It depends on how the page is intended to function.

The page needs more added for accessability and SEO though I added the basics.

The second page was also designed to look as similar as I could get it without a photoshop file, with the same exceptions as the first. 

The page is also created using the bootstrap grid system. It looks like you're meant to toggle the visibility of certian time boxes so this could be done with the display property.The menu at the top could also have opacity toggled as any navbar would.
